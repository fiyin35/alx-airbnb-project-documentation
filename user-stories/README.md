# User Stories - Airbnb Clone Backend
# Overview
This directory contains the user stories documentation for the Airbnb Clone backend project. The user stories are derived from the comprehensive use case diagram and represent the functional requirements from the user's perspective.

# Purpose
User stories serve as the bridge between high-level requirements and actual implementation, providing:

Clear understanding of user needs and expectations
Acceptance criteria for testing and validation
Prioritization framework for development planning
Communication tool between stakeholders and development team
